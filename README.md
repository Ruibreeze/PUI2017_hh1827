# PUI 2017_hh1827

- I created a directory on your computer or on your workspace on CUSP compute called PUI2017.
- I created an environmental variable PUI2017 that points to that directory so that typing echo $PUI2017 returns the full path to the directory. Save it in your .bashrc (linux) or .bash_profile (OS X) so that every time I open a new terminal the terminal knows what the $PUI2017 env var is set to. create an alias such that typing pui2017 takes me to that directory
